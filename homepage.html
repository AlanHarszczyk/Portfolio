            <p class="pixel-text">Hi, I'm a Polish interactive digital art student currently based in Ireland. My passion lies in creating immersive and visually compelling digital experiences, with a focus on game asset design and interactive media.

                Over the years, I've worked on a variety of digital projects, ranging from concept art to fully realized game assets. One of my works was even featured in the Dingle competition. I have worked as the lead artist on game projects alongside amazing coders to bring the games to life with a focus on pixel art design.
                
                Collaboration is a key aspect of my creative journey—I have worked with teams to develop games, bringing ideas to life through design, storytelling, and technical execution. Beyond hands-on creation, I’ve also had the opportunity to share my insights by giving a talk to tech firms, where I discussed my projects and the creative processes behind them.
                
                I'm always eager to explore new creative challenges, expand my skill set, and collaborate with like-minded individuals in the world of digital art and game development.
